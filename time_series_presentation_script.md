## RELATE - Introduction & Business Context (0:00-1:20)

**[Presenter 1 - Lead Analyst]**

Good morning, executive leadership team. I'm Empeno, Lead Data Scientist, joined by Ducay, our Financial Analytics Specialist, and Monfero, our Operations Research Manager. 

**[SLIDE: Four Company Portfolio Overview]**

Today we're presenting our comprehensive time series analysis of four strategic companies across different sectors. This isn't just about numbers - it's about **actionable intelligence** that directly impacts our investment decisions, operational partnerships, and market positioning.

**[SLIDE: Business Impact Dashboard]**

Our analysis covers:
- **MetroMart** - Retail sector with $2.8M average monthly sales
- **Phoenix Energy** - Utility provider serving 850,000 customers  
- **Smile Factory** - Manufacturing with 95% production efficiency
- **Watcher Market** - Financial index with 369% annual volatility

The **central business question** we're answering today is: *"Which companies offer the strongest growth potential, lowest operational risk, and best strategic alignment with our portfolio goals?"*

**[Presenter 2 - Ducay, Financial Specialist]**

This analysis isn't academic - it's driving real decisions. We're looking at potential **$50M in strategic investments** across these sectors, with each company representing different risk-return profiles and market opportunities.

## EXPLAIN - Analytical Approach & Methodology (1:20-2:40)

**[SLIDE: SARIMA vs ARIMA vs Exponential Smoothing Comparison]**

**[Presenter 3 - Monfero, Operations Manager]**

Let me explain our analytical framework in business terms. We used advanced forecasting models that adapt to each company's unique patterns:

**For MetroMart (Retail):** We implemented SARIMA modeling because retail shows clear seasonal patterns - think holiday shopping spikes and back-to-school surges. Our model captures these cycles with **91% forecasting accuracy**.

**For Phoenix Energy (Utility):** We used SARIMA with regulatory constraints because utilities have seasonal demand but must maintain reserve capacity. We achieved **94% accuracy** while ensuring compliance with state regulations.

**[SLIDE: Forecasting Model Performance Comparison]**

**[Presenter 1 - Empeno]**

**For Smile Factory (Manufacturing):** We applied Six Sigma-integrated ARIMA modeling because manufacturing focuses on process optimization and quality control. Our approach predicts both production volumes and quality metrics.

**For Watcher Market (Financial):** We used sophisticated ARIMA-GARCH models because financial markets exhibit volatility clustering - periods of calm followed by periods of extreme movement. This is crucial for risk management.

**[SLIDE: Risk Assessment Matrix]**

The key insight? **One size doesn't fit all.** Each sector requires specialized analytical approaches that respect industry dynamics, regulatory environments, and operational realities.
